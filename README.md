# CMD-notify
Command line notification system

## Things left to do
The issues left are that the check method has to run in the background for the entirity of a computer lifetime! Futhermore the nofity program has to also be accessible in any location, there needs to be a textbox prompt and the notify needs to access the check method in the back to add active notfications. For now I will move on.
